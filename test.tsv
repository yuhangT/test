A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City	so it must seem to Jackie Mason, the veteran Jewish comedian appearing in a new ABC sitcom airing on Tuesday nights (9:30-10 p.m. EDT)	2
Not only is Mr. Mason the star of "Chicken Soup	he's the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to "Duck Soup," and he's currently a man in hot water	3
he's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to "Duck Soup	he's currently a man in hot water	3
quoted first in the Village Voice	he was a paid spokesman for the Rudolph Giuliani mayoral campaign	4
and then in Newsweek	he and the campaign parted company	4
that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks	they support black candidates uncritically	2
that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination	they, too, support black candidates uncritically	2
He said Jews were "sick with complexes	he called David Dinkins, Mr. Giuliani's black opponent, "a fancy shvartze with a mustache	3
would the water be quite so hot	Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers	2
It probably would	few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language	2
because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language	some of Mr. Mason's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism	3
In addition, some of Mr. Mason's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism	the New York state counsel for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is "like a dinosaur.	3
The latter typically is the humor of the underdog	it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves	3
In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce, this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons	wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason, it is a constructive form of mischief	1
Why constructive	despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing, they are similar in one respect: Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict	2
Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity	honest differences were allowed to simmer	2
group conflicts still exist	what other means do we have for letting off steam	2
if group conflicts still exist	if Mr. Mason's type of ethnic humor is passe	3
Mr. Mason's type of ethnic humor is passe	and what other means do we have for letting off steam	2
Don't say the TV sitcom	that happens to be a genre that, in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody, resembles politics more than it does comedy	2
that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer: yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in "Cheers"; children vs. adults in "The Cosby Show	these are not the differences that make headlines	1
that the plot has entered the public domain	it has remained there	3
Clearly, the question with "Chicken Soup" is not whether the pot will boil over	whether it will simmer at all	1
To some extent, this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them	Michael dislikes Jackie not because he's a shrewd Jewish businessman, but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker	3
For instance, Michael dislikes Jackie	he's a shrewd Jewish businessman	2
not because he's a shrewd Jewish businessman	because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker	1
For instance, Michael dislikes Jackie	but he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker	2
The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end (and occasionally in the middle), when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself	too often, these routines lack spark	1
But too often, these routines lack spark	this sitcom, like all sitcoms, is timid about confronting Mr. Mason's stock in trade-ethnic differences	2
That issue, like racial tensions in New York City, will have to cool down, not heat up	it can simmer	4
I'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz	I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about "caring for other people" that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America	1
