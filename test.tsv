It probably would.	few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language.	2
because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language.	some of Mr. Mason's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism.	1
In addition, some of Mr. Mason's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism.	the New York state counsel for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is "like a dinosaur..People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck.	1
The latter typically is the humor of the underdog.	it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves.	1
In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce, this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons.	wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason, it is a constructive form of mischief.	3
Why constructive.	despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing, they are similar in one respect: Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict.	2
Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity.	honest differences were allowed to simmer.	2
group conflicts still exist.	what other means do we have for letting off steam.	2
if group conflicts still exist.	if Mr. Mason's type of ethnic humor is passe.	1
Mr. Mason's type of ethnic humor is passe.	and what other means do we have for letting off steam.	2
Don't say the TV sitcom.	that happens to be a genre that, in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody, resembles politics more than it does comedy.	2
that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer: yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in "Cheers"; children vs. adults in "The Cosby Show.	these are not the differences that make headlines.	3
that the plot has entered the public domain.	it has remained there.	1
Clearly, the question with "Chicken Soup" is not whether the pot will boil over.	whether it will simmer at all.	3
To some extent, this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them.	Michael dislikes Jackie not because he's a shrewd Jewish businessman, but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker.	1
For instance, Michael dislikes Jackie.	he's a shrewd Jewish businessman.	2

For instance, Michael dislikes Jackie.	but he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker.	2
The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end (and occasionally in the middle), when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself.	too often, these routines lack spark.	3
But too often, these routines lack spark.	this sitcom, like all sitcoms, is timid about confronting Mr. Mason's stock in trade-ethnic differences.	2
That issue, like racial tensions in New York City, will have to cool down, not heat up.	it can simmer.	4
I'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz.	I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about "caring for other people" that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America.	3

This privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify.	in a criminal case, a prosecutor cannot comment on a defendant's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness, thus forcing him to "take the Fifth.	2

He may take the Fifth in a civil matter.	he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution.	2
