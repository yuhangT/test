Today, the pixie-like clarinetist has mostly dropped the missionary work	a touch of the old Tashi still survives	1
Just the thing for the Vivaldi-at-brunch set, the yuppie audience that has embraced New Age as its very own easy listening	you can't dismiss Mr. Stoltzman's music or his motives as merely commercial and lightweight	1
He believes in what he plays	he plays superbly	3
that his new album, "Inner Voices," had just been released, that his family was in the front row	that it was his mother's birthday	3
and that it was his mother's birthday	he was going to play her favorite tune from the record	2
He launched into Saint-Saens's "The Swan" from "Carnival of the Animals," a favorite encore piece for cellists, with lovely, glossy tone and no bite	he offered the second movement from Saint-Saens's Sonata for Clarinet, a whimsical, puckish tidbit that reflected the flip side of the Stoltzman personality	4
Then he offered the second movement from Saint-Saens's Sonata for Clarinet, a whimsical, puckish tidbit that reflected the flip side of the Stoltzman personality	to show that he could play fast as well	3
Then, as if to show that he could play fast as well, he offered the second movement from Saint-Saens's Sonata for Clarinet, a whimsical, puckish tidbit that reflected the flip side of the Stoltzman personality	so it went through the first half: an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces, none longer than five minutes, none that would disturb or challenge a listener	3
Mr. Stoltzman tied the composer in by proclaiming him "the great improviser of the 18th century	and built on the image by joining with Mr. Douglas in some Bach two-part inventions	4
and then built on the image by joining with Mr. Douglas in some Bach two-part inventions	the two chanted and chortled their way through some murderous polyrhythms	4
the two then chanted and chortled their way through some murderous polyrhythms	and with Mr. Gomez, soared and improvised on the composer's tight "Bebop Etudes	4
And so it went through the first half: an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces, none longer than five minutes, none that would disturb or challenge a listener	The end of the first half brought what the standing-room-only crowd seemed to be waiting for: the pop singer Judy Collins	1
Glamorous and pure-voiced as ever, Ms. Collins sang Joni Mitchell's "For Free" -- about an encounter with a street-corner clarinetist, to which Mr. Stoltzman contributed a clarinet obligatto -- and Mr. Douglas's lush setting of a Gaelic blessing, "Deep Peace	Deep Peace" featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds, beaches, deserts, sunsets, etc	3
It was all too mellow to be believed	they probably would have gotten away with it, had they not felt compelled to add Ms. Collins's signature tune, "Amazing Grace," and ask for audience participation	1
Was this why some of the audience departed before or during the second half	was it because Ms. Collins had gone	3
Was this why some of the audience departed before or during the second half	was it because Ms. Collins had gone	3
Or was it	Ms. Collins had gone	2
Either way it was a pity	Mr. Stolzman offered the most substantial music of the evening just after intermission: Steve Reich's "New York Counterpoint," one of a series of Reich works that juxtapose a live performer with recorded tracks of his or her own playing	2
He warned us in advance that "New York Counterpoint" lasts 11 1/2 minutes	He unfortunately illustrated this intricate, jazzy tapestry with Mr. Pearson's images, this time of geometric or repeating objects, in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure that was thoroughly distracting from Mr. Reich's piece and Mr. Stoltzman's elegant execution of it	3
It was enjoyable to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a smoke-filled club	like the first half, much of it was easy to take and ultimately forgettable	1
Managers and presenters insist that chamber music concerts are a hard sell	can audiences really enjoy them only if the music is purged of threatening elements, served up in bite-sized morsels and accompanied by visuals	1
but can audiences really enjoy them	the music is purged of threatening elements, served up in bite-sized morsels and accompanied by visuals	2
It was not an unpleasant evening, certainly, thanks to the high level of performance, the compositional talents of Mr. Douglas, and the obvious sincerity with which Mr. Stoltzman chooses his selections	it was neither deep nor lasting: light entertainment that was no substitute for an evening of Brahms	1

that prevents the production of pollen	The gene can prevent a plant from fertilizing itself	2
The gene thus can prevent a plant from fertilizing itself	Such so-called male-sterile plants can be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant	4
Such so-called male-sterile plants can then be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant	producing hybrid seed	2
That's	the male part, the tassel, and the female, the ear, are some distance apart on the corn plant	2
They sow a row of male-fertile plants nearby	which pollinate the male-sterile plants	4
The first hybrid corn seeds produced using this mechanical approach were introduced in the 1930s	they yielded as much as 20% more corn than naturally pollinated plants	3
In China, a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male organs of rice plants using tweezers	one-third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds	3
The sterilizing gene is expressed	the pollen is about to develop	4
The sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop	it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the plant	3
At Plant Genetic Systems, researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility	The researchers pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop	3
They attached a second gene, for herbicide resistance, to the pollen-inhibiting gene	Both genes are inserted into a few greenhouse plants	4
Both genes are then inserted into a few greenhouse plants	which are pollinated and allowed to mature and produce seed	4
that half of the plants springing from these greenhouse-produced seeds will be male sterile and herbicide resistant	half will be male fertile and herbicide susceptible	3
that the genetic approach will obviate the need for mechanical emasculation of anthers	virtually all corn seeds currently planted are hybrids	1
One technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a plant's pollen	there have been problems with chemical sprays damaging plants' female reproductive organs and concern for the toxicity of such chemical sprays to humans, animals and beneficial insects	1
But there have been problems with chemical sprays damaging plants' female reproductive organs and concern for the toxicity of such chemical sprays to humans, animals and beneficial insects	the company's chemical spray overcomes these problems and is "gentle on the female organ	1
That's	pollination is more complex and involves insects as carriers in crops such as cotton	2
because pollination is more complex and involves insects as carriers in crops such as cotton	easy in corn because the carrier is wind	1
while easy in corn	the carrier is wind	2

On balance, we think it will be positive	some Japanese government officials and businessmen worry that the prominent purchase is just the sort of deal that should be avoided for the time being	1

Those who have no money and aren't buying think it's right to refrain, but those with money who want to buy for themselves pay no attention	to Mitsubishi Estate, the acquisition has just the elements that should win support from both sides	1
First of all, it is a friendly acquisition in which Rockefeller sought out Mitsubishi Estate and asked it to buy a majority share.	Mitsubishi Estate has no plans to interfere with Rockefeller's management beyond taking a place on the board	3
We'll continue to work with them, in keeping with the reputation of the company	we'll rely very much on their leadership	3
that has the pejorative connotation of doing the government's bidding	but suggests the clout inherent in maintaining such close ties	3
It's known for its cautiousness	it has had little need for bold overseas ventures	2
Rockefeller isn't the first overseas purchase for Mitsubishi Estate -- it has already played a leading role in designing Los Angeles's Citicorp Plaza	the Rockefeller investment is its largest	1
But the Rockefeller investment is its largest	it will barely make a dent in Mitsubishi Estate's finances	1
Mitsubishi Estate hasn't decided how it will raise the funds for the purchase, which are due in cash next April	the Marunouchi holdings alone are estimated to have a market value of as much as 10 trillion yen to 11 trillion yen	1

The two sides in the legal battle have hurled accusations of duplicity at each other for weeks, and both Warner and Sony have accused each other of trying to sabotage each other's prospects for success in the entertainment business	it may amount to little more than posturing	1
the two have continued on-again, off-again settlement talks over the last few weeks	the matter could be resolved within a week	3
Both Warner and Sony declined to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions	the people familiar with the talks said that Warner isn't expected to get any cash in the settlement	1
that Warner isn't expected to get any cash in the settlement	Sony is likely to agree to let Warner participate in certain of its businesses, such as the record club of Sony's CBS Records unit	3

who will be chairman and co-chief executive officer of Time Warner	the merger is complete	4
Mr. Ross denied that in his own affidavit, and called Mr. Yetnikoff's remarks "vicious" and his claims "reckless, irresponsible and baseless," saying Warner under his leadership has started a number of businesses in Japan	Mr. Ross said he enjoys "warm professional and personal relationships" with Japanese executives including Sony Chairman Akio Morita, "who has visited my home here	3
Still, it may be tough for the two to have a smooth partnership in anything, in the wake of sworn affidavits filed over the last week	despite the acrimony between Mr. Ross and Mr. Yetnikoff, officials of the Time side of Time Warner have reportedly been increasingly interested in a settlement that might yield attractive business opportunities	1
as they have more than once	Sony announced its plans to hire Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters	4
Talks between the two sides could unravel, of course, as they have more than once since Sony announced its plans to hire Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters	both sides appear to be more willing now to meet each other's terms to resolve the issue	1
But both sides appear to be more willing now to meet each other's terms to resolve the issue	although Warner has said it wanted the producers to fulfill the terms of their contract, the producers said in sworn court declarations that they didn't believe the relationship could be repaired after the acrimony of the legal battle	3

to exclude Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters from any of the projects they were working on at Warner	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters almost certainly wouldn't be able to participate in future sequels to "Batman," the blockbuster hit they produced for Warner	3
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters also almost certainly wouldn't be able to participate in future sequels to "Batman," the blockbuster hit they produced for Warner	in acquiring Guber-Peters Entertainment, Sony will actually get a piece of the profits from "Batman," since the publicly held concern gets certain revenue from the movies Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters produce	1

For a while in the 1970s it seemed Mr. Moon was on a spending spree, with such purchases as the former New Yorker Hotel and its adjacent Manhattan Center; a fishing/processing conglomerate with branches in Alaska, Massachusetts, Virginia and Louisiana; a former Christian Brothers monastery and the Seagram family mansion (both picturesquely situated on the Hudson River); shares in banks from Washington to Uruguay; a motion picture production company, and newspapers, such as the Washington Times, the New York City Tribune (originally the News World), and the successful Spanish-language Noticias del Mundo	these purchases can be misleading	1
Those teams of young fund-raisers selling flowers, peanuts or begging outright at traffic intersections brought in somewhere near $20 million a year during the mid-to-late 1970s	those revenues were a pittance compared to the costs of Mr. Moon's lavish international conferences, speaking tours, and assorted land buys	1

At a time when most analysts and industry consultants say pulp and paper prices are heading for a dive, adding capacity and debt could squeeze Georgia-Pacific if the industry declines more than the company expects	any unexpected strengthening of the dollar would hurt Georgia-Pacific because two of Nekoosa's major product lines -- containerboard, which is used to make shipping boxes, and market pulp -- are exported in large quantities	3
Moreover, any unexpected strengthening of the dollar would hurt Georgia-Pacific	two of Nekoosa's major product lines -- containerboard and market pulp -- are exported in large quantities	2
the acquisition would more than double the company's debt of almost $3 billion	It could be a drag on Georgia-Pacific earnings	3
It also could be a drag on Georgia-Pacific earnings	the roughly $1.5 billion in goodwill -- the amount by which the bid exceeds Nekoosa's book value of $1.5 billion -- will have to be subtracted from earnings over a period of decades	2
That means goods could be manufactured closer to customers, saving shipping costs	production runs would be longer, cutting inefficiencies from adjusting machinery between production cycles	3

This is a one-time event," said Lawrence Ross of PaineWebber Inc., referring to the Georgia-Pacific bid	many analysts believe that, given the attractiveness of paper companies' cash flows, as well as the frantic consolidation of the paper industry in Europe, there will be at least a few more big hostile bids for U.S. companies within the next several months	1

Two of the major factors buoying prices, the prolonged strikes at the Highland Valley mine in Canada and the Cananea mine in Mexico, were finally resolved	the premiums paid by the U.S. government on a purchase of copper for the U.S. Mint were lower than expected, and acted as a price depressant	3

If Mr. Gorbachev's goal is the creation of a free market, he and these Western observers have good reason to fear for his future	economic liberalization within communist societies leads inexorably to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest	2
These fears were clearly apparent	last week, Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert, on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev's economic reforms succeeding	4
These fears were clearly apparent when, last week, Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert, on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev's economic reforms succeeding	the Soviet leader's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power, particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30, do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika	1

Yet the Soviet leader's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power, particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30, do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika	the Soviet miners strike this summer clearly demonstrated that Mr. Gorbachev must proceed with economic reform	3
that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika	is he so clever that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run uphill	1
But is he so clever that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run uphill	has he truly persuaded the Communist Party to accept economic change of a kind that will, sooner or later, lead to its demise	3
An alternative and more convincing explanation, confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the Gorbachev program, is that the new Soviet economic and social structures are intended to conform to a model other than that of the market	while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state, strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the development of a free market	3

these latest resolutions are nothing short of reckless	Mr. Gorbachev is looking toward unleashing the productive forces of the market	2
that he is bent on creating economic structures of a kind that would scarcely find favor with the Austrian or Chicago schools of economic thought	Mr. Gorbachev wishes to move away from some rigid central controls	1
We do not share this approach	it would immediately destroy the social situation and disrupt all the processes in the country	2
Having rejected central economic planning for economic reasons, and the market for fear of the social (political) consequences, Mr. Gorbachev seeks a "third way" that would combine the discipline and controls of the former with the economic benefits of the latter	Mr. Gorbachev's proposals display a close conceptual resemblance to the tenets of Italian fascism, whose architects spoke specifically of a "third way": of having produced a historic synthesis of socialism and capitalism	3
The fascist concept of corporatism envisaged an "organic" society in which citizens were spiritually and morally unified, and prepared to sacrifice themselves for the nation	a parliamentary system based on abstract political rights and groups was held to cause, rather than resolve, conflict	1
The closeness of Soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of Mussolini was evident	Mr. Gorbachev presented his economic vision to the Soviet Congress	4
he rejected a socialist planned economy	embraced the free market	3
In doing so, he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market	he proposed a "law-governed economy," in which there would be a "clear-cut division between state direction of the economy and economic management	3
To ensure the loyalty of the business sector, Mr. Gorbachev may offer concessions and powers that will allow the business community to preserve its own interests, probably by restricting competition	Mr. Gorbachev must ensure that within this "alliance" the business sector remains subordinate to the party	1
that a cooperative be closed	its prices be reduced	3
The most important development in Mr. Gorbachev's policy for marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the U.S.S.R. also suffers from terrorism	Mr. Gorbachev would appear to see his central task as that of ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor, capital and the state are properly laid before the demands for a multiparty system reach a crescendo	1

Nigel Lawson's departure from the British government	who resigned as personal adviser to Mrs. Thatcher	3
There are the supply-side globalists, who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates	there are the twin-deficit Keynesians, who predict/advocate devaluations to balance trade flows	3
He not only slashed marginal tax rates, initially sparking fresh growth in Britain	he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates, indeed joining the European Monetary System	3
Sir Alan is a dyed-in-the-wool monetarist, inclined to defend floating rates to the death	no doubt agreeing with Mr. Lawson on everything else	1
By accounting definitions, this had to produce a sudden trade deficit	As in the U.S., it produced a sudden burst in the demand for sterling, that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates, M-Whatever	3
Faced with a similar situation, Paul Volcker let the dollar soar	monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly monetarists issued egg-on-the-face warnings of inflation	1

But more recently, the pound has been falling with high inflation	which has seemed almost impervious to the high interest rates Mr. Lawson deployed to stop it	3
But more recently, the pound has been falling with high inflation, which has also seemed almost impervious to the high interest rates Mr. Lawson deployed to stop it	the British experience presents a genuine puzzle that reaches far beyond the shores of Albion	2
We had been soliciting opinions on it	Mr. Lawson's resignation	4
To begin with, we should note that in contrast to the U.S. deficit, Britain has been running largish budget surpluses	We should add Mr. Lawson's own explanation, as we understand it	3
We should also add Mr. Lawson's own explanation, as we understand it	We should concede that in the British experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility it lost in the U.S. experience	3
Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates	of course in the event Mr. Lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound, not restrain a strong one	1

that high interest rates are less likely to curb inflation than to cause recession	British banks have no reserve requirements	2
to decide between the Chancellor and her adviser	neither policy was followed	3
In the end, neither policy was followed	instead of learning anything we are left with a mystery	3
In the end, neither policy was followed, and instead of learning anything we are left with a mystery	shadowing" a currency is anything but fixing; it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility	3
All the more so	strong voices are heard opposing the policy	4
In particular, "shadowing" a currency is anything but fixing; it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility.	Mr. Lawson had to resign	2

A major boost to Mr. Rey's respectability among the Swiss came in 1986 when he sold 60% of his Phibro Bank to the conservative Swiss cantonal banks In 1987, Mr. Rey bested leading publishing houses to take over Switzerland's Jean Frey AG, a major producer of magazines and newspapers	with the recent acquisition of 30% of Winterthur-based machinery manufacturer Gebrueder Sulzer AG, Mr. Rey has enjoyed the status of white knight	3

Donald H. Straszheim surely understands	a TV weatherman gets butterflies facing the camera again after a questionable forecast	2
The chief economist of Merrill Lynch & Co. finds himself in such a position	he buzzes the Midwest on his first road trip since backpedaling on a major prediction	4
Mr. Straszheim expects he will take some heat	he's right	3
Since the last time he traveled this way several months ago, he has recanted a series of bold forecasts of a recession	In February 1988 Merrill Lynch's weekly commentary announced that "the economy is likely to fall into recession in early 1989	3
The forecasts were widely disseminated	in a splashy ad campaign launched in the summer of 1988, Merrill Lynch urged investors to buy bonds	3
long-term interest rates, then above 9%, could drop to 7% by the end of 1989	bonds, which benefit from falling rates, would be a good buy	2
and, in a splashy ad campaign launched in the summer of 1988, Merrill Lynch urged investors to buy bonds	The firm raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from 40% to 45% and later to 55%	3
In February 1988, for example, Merrill Lynch's weekly commentary announced that "the economy is likely to fall into recession in early 1989	this September he took a detour if not a U-turn	1
He softened the talk about a recession	Now he is predicting economic growth of 2.9% this year and 2.1% next year, a more optimistic outlook than the consensus of some four dozen top forecasters surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter	3
Now, in fact, he is predicting economic growth of 2.9% this year and 2.1% next year, a more optimistic outlook than the consensus of some four dozen top forecasters surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter	just recently, Merrill Lynch cut the recommended bondholdings back to 50%	3
they aren't	such changes might sound minor	1
Now a rocky stock market and weak corporate profits may further threaten the economy	that "it may prove to be the case that we got whipsawed -- that we pulled the recession forecast at just the wrong time	3
Pestered by bosses, brokers, clients and media people and pushed by their own egos, Wall Street economists are forecasting about everything from broad economic trends to the dinkiest monthly indicator	the surprisingly durable seven-year economic expansion has made mincemeat of more than one forecast	1

A good half-hour into breakfast at the Palmer House, Mr. O'Brien looks up from his plate	Mr. Straszheim says something about people who believe interest rates are about to nosedive	4
He doesn't fully succeed	Mr. Straszheim lists an array of interest-rate scenarios	1
Dennis O'Brien, the treasurer of Commonwealth Edison Co. in Chicago, adopts a polite approach, waiting for an opportunity to ask about the forecast	In a chilly conference room at Alliance Capital Management in Minneapolis the firm's money managers seem ready to pin Mr. Straszheim to the wall	1

The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, resigned	Prime Minister Thatcher would not fire her trusted adviser Sir Alan Walters	2
the dispute is worth examining	there is an effort to "anchor the dollar" either to gold or other currencies	2

the British would have been unable to cut their exorbitant tax rates	the pound had been tied to the mark	2
it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency	a country cuts tax rates	2
This misguided policy could not prevent a British trade deficit	Mr. Lawson saddled Mrs. Thatcher with a record trade deficit, renewed inflation and high interest rates -- three political failures in a row	2
that the flow abroad of British capital slowed, to 50 billion pounds ($79 billion at the current rate) in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986	the top tax rate was cut to 40%	4
The most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment	emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates	3
First comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency's value that was pushed up by tax-rate reduction	when the currency falls, interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate	4
Then interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate	the currency falls	4
This policy is totally mindless	Sir Alan is correct to point out its deficiencies	3
German reunification is likely to require Germany's neutralization	the Soviet Union collapses	3
The implications for Britain, France and the rest of Europe of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering	we judge Mr. Lawson's resignation to be unfortunate	4

Market makers in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks are adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading	Their motivation has a strong practical aspect	3
Program trading is hazardous to their paychecks	Program trading causes the Nasdaq Composite Index to lose ground against other segments of the stock market	3
Because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many OTC stocks without sharp price moves, a condition known as illiquidity	the price volatility that is amplified by program trading is undercutting efforts to woo individual investors back to an OTC market that sorely misses them	3
Some of these problems are neither new nor unique to the OTC market	the big, often tumultuous slide in stock prices this month has turned some of those who have been profiting from the practice against it	1

who was derided as a "tool-and-die man	GE brought him in to clean up Kidder in 1987	4
By the end of this year, 63-year-old Chairman Silas Cathcart -- the former chairman of Illinois Tool Works who was derided as a "tool-and-die man" when GE brought him in to clean up Kidder in 1987 -- retires to his Lake Forest, Ill., home	that means 42-year-old Michael Carpenter, president and chief executive since January, will for the first time take complete control of Kidder and try to make good on some grandiose plans	3
I'd like to see (Kidder) succeed	they have to attract good senior bankers who can bring in the business from day one	1

In fact, Kidder is a minor player in just about every business it does except computer-driven program trading; in that controversial business, only Morgan Stanley & Co. rivals Kidder	even that niche is under attack, as several Wall Street firms pulled back from program trading last week under pressure from big investors	1
But even that niche is under attack	several Wall Street firms pulled back from program trading last week under pressure from big investors	2
The firm's brokerage force has been trimmed	its mergers-and-acquisitions staff increased to a record 55 people	3
that Kidder will finally tap the resources of GE	he assumes full control	4
One of GE's goals was to take advantage of "syngeries" between Kidder and General Electric Capital Corp., GE's corporate-finance unit, which has $42 billion in assets	it bought 80% of Kidder in 1986	4
So far, instead of teaming up, GE Capital staffers and Kidder investment bankers have bickered	We've really started to exploit the synergy between GE Capital and Kidder Peabody	1
The units have worked on 37 investment banking deals this year	not all of them have panned out	1
It's been a steadily improving relationship	without many actual deals to show off, Kidder is left to stress that it finally has "a team" in place, and that everyone works harder	1

As part of the upscale push, Kidder is putting brokers through a 20-week training course, turning them into "investment counselors" with knowledge of corporate finance	Theoretically, the brokers will be able to funnel "leads" on corporate finance opportunities to Kidder's investment bankers	4

Theoretically, the brokers will then be able to funnel "leads" on corporate finance opportunities to Kidder's investment bankers	skeptics caution that this kind of cross-pollination between brokers and investment bankers looks great on paper, but doesn't always happen	1
Kidder competitors aren't outwardly hostile to the firm	competitors say that Kidder's hiring binge involving executive-level staffers, some with multiple-year contract guarantees, could backfire unless there are results	1

At an estimated $360 million, the project would represent the single largest foreign investment in the Philippines since President Corazon Aquino took office in February 1986	It is considered critical to the country's efforts to both attract other investment from Taiwan and raise heavy industry capabilities	3

In addition, President Aquino has yet to sign into law a bill removing a stiff 48% tax on naphtha, the principal raw material to be used in the cracker	at a news conference Thursday, Mrs. Aquino backed the project and said her government was attempting to soothe the feelings of residents at the original site, adjacent to the government's major petroleum refinery in Bataan province	1
We have tried our best to tell the people in Bataan that maybe this time it will not go to them	certainly we will do our best to encourage other investors to go to their province	1
The project appeared to be on the rocks earlier this month when the other major partner in the project, China General Plastics Corp., backed out	that USI Far East is confident other investors will take up the slack	1

it's far more than the budgetary gimmick it may seem at first glance	it's a device that could send shock waves through the president's entire relationship with Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress, fundamentally enhance the power of the presidency and transform the way the government does its business	3
it would set off a political earthquake	that may sound like an arcane maneuver of little interest outside Washington	1
White House aides know it's a step that can't be taken lightly	for that reason, the president may back down from launching a test case this year	3
They prefer to put off the line-item veto until at least next year	Mr. Bush and some other aides are strongly drawn to the idea of trying out a line-item veto	1
Those bills can't easily be vetoed in their entirety	they often are needed to keep the government operating	2

that he would single-handedly kill the BART funds	the congressman "shapes up" on the foreign-policy issue	3
Proponents maintain that a president would choose to use a line-item veto more judiciously than that	there may be another problem with the device: Despite all the political angst it would cause, it mightn't be effective in cutting the deficit	1
Governors have found that they have to use the device sparingly to maintain political comity	it isn't even clear that some pork-barrel projects can be hit with a line-item veto because they tend to be listed in informal conference reports accompanying spending bills rather than in the official bills themselves	3

State loan guarantees are rarely a source of controversy	some bankers cited possible parallels between the Waertsilae Marine case and the collapse of Norway's state-owned Kongsberg Vappenfabrikk AS two years ago	1
In that case, international banks and investors incurred big losses	they incorrectly believed the company's debt carried implicit state guarantees	2

the Soviet Union's official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted meat	Mr. Shevardnadze did not address this topic before the Supreme Soviet	2
We doubt this claim just as we doubted Mr. Shevardnadze's assurance last year that Krasnoyarsk didn't violate the ABM treaty	just as we did not believe the tendentious claims of the Congressmen and arms-control advocates who visited Krasnoyarsk, we are in no way persuaded by the assent to the tainted-meat theory by a U.S. team of scientists who met with Soviet counterparts in Washington last year	3

The 321-99 roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance	the cost to the Treasury is sure to aggravate budget pressures this year and next under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law	1

Because of the vagaries of Gramm-Rudman, the immediate impact is relatively small	the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal 1991	1

The House approved a short-term spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake as a House-Senate conference approved a nearly $8.5 billion fiscal 1990 military construction bill, representing a 5% reduction from last year and making severe cuts from Pentagon requests for installations abroad	House-Senate negotiators have tentatively agreed on a $3.18 billion anti-drug and anti-crime intitiative, cutting other federal spending 0.43% to pay for it	3

Star lecturer at Harvard, author of numerous popular books on science, and scourge of the creationist lobby, Mr. Gould is perhaps the world's most eminent evolutionary theorist	he puts quite a twist on the old story handed down from Darwin	1
The received Darwinian wisdom of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design, limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary species	the hidebound traditionalist reconstructed hypothetical organisms from the Burgess fossils in such a way that they could be shoehorned into familiar categories	2

the nation's theatrical cognoscenti arched a collective eyebrow	the Trinity Repertory Theater named Anne Bogart its artistic director last spring	4
Ms. Bogart, an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages that tear into such sacred texts as Rodgers and Hammerstein's "South Pacific," is decidedly downtown	Trinity Rep is one of the nation's oldest and most respected regional theaters	1
For Ms. Bogart, who initially studied and directed in Germany (and cites such European directors as Peter Stein, Giorgio Strehler and Ariane Mnouchkine as influences) tends to stage her productions with a Brechtian rigor -- whether the text demands it or not	Gorky, considered the father of Soviet socialist realism, did not write plays that easily lend themselves to deliberately antirealistic distancing techniques	3
Gorky was a loyal if occasionally ambivalent proletarian writer committed to enlightening the masses with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of Chekhovian humanism	Summerfolk," penned in 1904 as a kind of sequel to Chekhov's "Cherry Orchard," is a lawn party of Russian yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers	3
And "Summerfolk is a lawn party of Russian yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers	Along the way there are lots of romantic dalliances	3
Despite the absence of samovars (and a tendency to turn the furniture upside down), the production is rich in Russian ennui voiced by languorous folk sporting beige linen and rumpled cotton, with boaters and fishing poles aplenty	beyond this decorative nod to tradition, Ms. Bogart and company head off in a stylistic direction that all but transforms Gorky's naturalistic drama into something akin to, well, farce	1
Not only do the actors stand outside their characters and make it clear they are at odds with them	they often literally stand on their heads	3
Like Peter Sellars, Ms. Bogart manipulates her actors	they were rag dolls	3
even hanging them from precipices	having them perform some gymnastic feats of derring-do	4
The clash of ideologies survives this treatment	the nuance and richness of Gorky's individual characters have vanished in the scuffle	1
As for the humor that Gorky's text provides it looks and sounds forced	repainted in such broad strokes (particularly by the lesser members of the ensemble)	4
Ms. Bogart does better with music than with words	she wants, as she so often does want, to express herself through Gorky's helpless play	4

he declared: "I'll be able to beat any computer for the next five years	he were Iron Mike, about to enter the ring with a 98-pound weakling	3
Its chief builder, Taiwan-born Feng-hsiung Hsu, nicknamed his brainchild "the Weasel" for its tactical flair at wriggling out of horrible positions	D.T. has a prodigious and flawless memory, is utterly fearless, and couldn't be distracted by the sexy nude sculptures spread around the playing hall, in the New York Academy of Art	3

but they put their hope in D.T.'s recently enhanced capacity for examining positions -- up to a million per second, from 720,000	the handlers mistakenly stuck with silicon chips; they needed kryptonite	1
This became apparent	game one, a Sicilian Defense by Mr. Kasparov, proceeded	4
No human can examine millions of moves	Mr. Kasparov, using his ineffably powerful brain, consistently found very good ones	1
After eight moves by each side, the board was the same as in a game in which Nigel Short of Great Britain fought the champion to a draw in 1980	the computer didn't play Mr. Short's ninth move, a key pawn thrust, and its position deteriorated rapidly	1

D.T. made a second-rate rook maneuver at move 13	it put a knight offside on move 16	4

Mr. Kasparov maneuvered the knight to a dominant outpost	He launched a kingside storm, sacrificing a pawn to denude D.T.'s king	3
This left the computer with a broader range of plausible replies	it immediately blundered by moving a queenside pawn, to the neglect of kingside development	3
As early as move six, Mr. Kasparov deviated from a well-known sequence of moves, developing a knight instead of making a standard bishop attack against the computer's advanced knight.	In a new position just after the opening, a computer will have serious problems," Mr. Kasparov said	4
In such positions you have to create something new	the computer isn't able to do that right now	3

Reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake	you don't understand what you're investing in	2
Yields on five-year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45%	10-year Treasury notes were paying less than 8%	3
The CD seemed like a great deal	nearly 3 1/2 years later, Merrill says the investment is worth about $43,000 -- an amount that represents an annual return of just over 2% on Dr. Blumenfeld's $40,000	1
that the CD he bought for a retirement plan wasn't a plain vanilla CD	his Merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon CD	3
part of the price Dr. Blumenfeld paid was a premium -- an additional amount on top of the CD's base value plus accrued interest that represented the CD's increased market value	the CD had an effective yield of 13.4% when it was issued in 1984, and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then	2
Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4%	it was issued in 1984	4
Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4% when it was issued in 1984	interest rates in general had declined sharply since then	3
Now the thrift that issued the CD is insolvent	Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium isn't insured under federal deposit insurance	3
The tip-off came	he opened a recent Merrill Lynch statement and found that the CD's "estimated current market value" had plummeted by $9,000 in a month	4
he paid	he bought the CD	4
that the $9,000 drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the CD	that the amount wasn't insured	3
that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD	that he had previously invested in TIGRs (Treasury Income Growth Receipts), a type of zero-coupon Treasury security sold by Merrill Lynch	3
that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs (Treasury Income Growth Receipts), a type of zero-coupon Treasury security sold by Merrill Lynch	he didn't understand he was buying the CD on the secondary market, and he contends his broker never fully explained the risks	1
he didn't understand he was buying the CD on the secondary market	his broker never fully explained the risks	3
the difference . . . is not insured	the price paid for a CD purchased in the secondary market . . . is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon CDs	2
Computations involving zero-coupon CDs are more complicated	you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant	3
Those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a "fact sheet" sent to all CD investors with their confirmation of sale	Merrill Lynch has agreed that if the thrift that issued Dr. Blumenfeld's CD, Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association in Salina, Kan., is liquidated and the CD terminated, the brokerage firm would cover the premium Dr. Blumenfeld paid	1
that the brokerage firm would cover the premium Dr. Blumenfeld paid	the thrift that issued Dr. Blumenfeld's CD, Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association in Salina, Kan., is liquidated and the CD terminated	2
if the thrift that issued Dr. Blumenfeld's CD, Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association in Salina, Kan., is liquidated	the CD terminated	3
it's impossible to estimate how many investors are in Dr. Blumenfeld's situation	the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years	1
Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding	those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total	3
Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding, and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total	there are several billion dollars of zero-coupon CDs with various maturities outstanding	1
income tax is payable in the year interest is accrued	interest isn't actually paid until maturity	1
Most zero-coupon CDs are in maturities of six to nine years	they usually double in value by maturity	3
and Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium isn't insured under federal deposit insurance	investors who bought zero-coupon CDs in the secondary market aren't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments isn't insured	1
But investors who bought zero-coupon CDs in the secondary market aren't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments isn't insured	People who paid a premium for standard CDs purchased on the secondary market could find that those premiums aren't insured if the institutions that issued the CDs failed	3
that those premiums aren't insured	the institutions that issued the CDs failed	2
that those premiums aren't insured if the institutions that issued the CDs failed	those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon CDs, and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid	1
However, those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon CDs	the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid	3
and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent	a premium is paid	4
Whatever the case investors shouldn't have to worry about the uninsured premium issue	the bank or thrift that issued the CD is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate	3
unless the bank or thrift that issued the CD is closed	its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate	3

the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments' quiescent times	they were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time	3

the rest is easy, right	YOU MAKE UP your mind about an investment	4
to get burned	you don't know what you're doing	2
There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you don't know what you're doing	here's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges	2
Not all exchanges accept every type of order	even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange, a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer	3
And a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer	a specific order is acceptable to an exchange	1
and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers	it imposes no price restrictions	2
get me in now	get me out now	3
With a market order, an investor tells a broker to buy or sell "at the market	if wheat is being offered at $4.065 and bid at $4.060, a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price	3
For example a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price	wheat is being offered at $4.065 and bid at $4.060	2
that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers	Profits realized from these trades would be shared by the conspiring brokers	4
Limit orders are used	investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment	2
Investors may regret the restriction	the stock reaches 54 and then falls	2
if the stock reaches 54	and falls	4
investors aren't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price	the market goes at least one tick (the smallest price increment permitted) beyond the limit price	3
Unless the market goes at least one tick (the smallest price increment permitted) beyond the limit price, investors aren't assured of having their orders filled	there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price	2
to buy or sell an investment	the price reaches a certain level	4
to buy or sell an investment	the price reaches a certain level	2
a stop order turns into a market order, and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get	the price reaches that level	4
a stop order turns into a market order, and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get	the price reaches that level	2
Once the price reaches that level, a stop order turns into a market order	the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get	3
Once the price reaches that level, a stop order turns into a market order	the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get	4
Stop orders are sometimes called "stop-loss" orders	they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses	2
there is a difference	stop orders sound similar to limit orders	1
Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price	buy stops above	3
Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above	sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below	1
In contrast, sell limit orders must be placed above the market price	buy limit orders are placed below	3
that the order was filled at $75	the stock opened at that price on Monday	4
Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders	an investment trades at the price specified in the order	2
which are filled at the market price	the stop price is hit	4
which are filled at the market price	the stop price is hit	2
it doesn't get filled	it can't be made at that price	2
Investors who wish to be out of a position, without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order, may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled	if the market moves quickly enough, it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price	1
But it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order	the market moves quickly enough	2
But it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order	the investment has passed the specified price	2
in that they become market orders	a specified price is reached	2
Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached	unlike a buy-stop order, a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price	1
However, unlike a buy-stop order, a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price	a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it	1
the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price	the market trades at the specified price	4
It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better	if the investment can't be bought or sold immediately, the order is automatically canceled	1
But the order is automatically canceled	the investment can't be bought or sold immediately	2
he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively	trading options	2
they don't fill it immediately	I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price	2
to take more time to buy or sell an investment	they think they can get a better price by waiting	2
to fill whichever order they can first	and cancel the other order	4
On the close" can be added to many types of orders	market-on-close orders" must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange. "Stop-close-only orders" are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading. "Day orders" expire at the end of the day on which they are entered, "good-till-canceled orders" have no expiration date	3
of entering "good-til-canceled limit orders	and forgetting about them	4
who change their mind about buying or selling	an order has been filled	4
IN SIZING UP the risks of stock-market investments, there's probably no starting place better than "beta	investors better not ignore its limitations, either	1
The beta of the broad market, typically defined as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, is always 1.0	a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile, one at 1.5 is 50% more volatile, and so on	2
Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas.	Remember that beta also has important limitations	1
Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret	that beta has important limitations	3
There is risk that is not associated with market moves	the beta doesn't tell you the magnitude of that	3
and the beta doesn't tell you the magnitude of that	beta doesn't measure the company- and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock	3
That "business" risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks	it virtually disappears in a large and well-diversified portfolio	1
In particular, beta doesn't measure the company- and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock	Beta is a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer	3
Beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer	the prices of gold and other precious-metals stocks shoot up and down, but the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market-inspired	3

The younger couple's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio	the bulk of the money is in a single issue	2
Note that the younger couple's portfolio has a higher expected annual return, 10.1% vs. 8.8%, as calculated by Seidman Financial Services, which is the financial-planning affiliate of BDO Seidman	one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility	1

The plan indeed raises from 40% to 50% the number of freshmen applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria Since the "yield" from this top slice of applicants is relatively low, boosting admits from 40% to 50% will boost registrants from about 31% to 38% of the class In addition, perhaps 5% of registrants will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials "narrowly missed" gaining them admission in the first category But against that combined increase of 12% in students chosen by academic criteria, the plan eliminates a large category in which admissions now are based on grades, test scores and "supplemental points" for factors such as high-school curriculum, English-language proficiency and an essay.	The plan will decrease by 22%, for a net loss of 10%, the number of students admitted primarily by academic criteria	2

That's why some investment managers, such as Alex Powers, a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank's private banking division, don't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax states, such as New York or California	Mr. Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts, such as retirement plans	1
to sell their holdings quickly	the securities mature	4
You could see massive gyrations here	it's such a thinly traded market	2
The secondary, or resale, market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues	an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds, or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange, can simply check newspaper listings	3
Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem	Investors may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities	3
that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and "do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks, Citibank N.A., Citicorp or any affiliate thereof	if there's a problem, don't expect Citibank to come to the rescue	3
In other words don't expect Citibank to come to the rescue	there's a problem	2
The front cover of the prospectus for the Citibank credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and "do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks, Citibank N.A., Citicorp or any affiliate thereof	The prospectus notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency	3
Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem	That isn't easy	3

Details of credit enhancements vary widely from issue to issue	they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues	1

Still, they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues -- which in turn is why the yield above Treasurys is so slim	skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper	1
why you should bother buying this stuff	you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper	2

you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties	you buy an asset-backed issue	2
you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties	you buy an asset-backed issue	4
that could also affect the ratings, liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports	a bank's credit rating was lowered because of, say, its loans to Third World nations	2
If a bank's credit rating was lowered because of, say, its loans to Third World nations	that could affect the ratings, liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports	3
Underwriters insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions	despite the credit enhancements, despite the high ratings, some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets	1
That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities, as well as make it tougher to unload the latter	it could be much worse	1
For one thing, credit-card loans are unsecured	that banks have been overeager to issue cards to the public -- giving cards to too many big spenders who will default during a recession	3
A day of reckoning is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues	therefore we think the best debt investment is U.S. government bonds	3

Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities	voting in office	4
If they put a Republican into office, not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits	their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from "bringing home the bacon" to their respective constituencies	3
Each legislator, after all, is only one out of 535	it comes to national policy making	2
such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits	a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter's particular district/state	1
Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter's particular district/state	such a president is likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits	3
Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter's particular district/state, such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits	The individual voter's standing will be enhanced through lower taxes	2
Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, government occupied a much smaller role in society	the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe	3
Third, the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office	first-term members of the House, once the most vulnerable of incumbents, have become virtually immune to defeat	3
they were more vulnerable to defeat	these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role in national policy making	2
First, why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century Second, it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives Third, the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office Fourth, the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office Fifth, the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South	the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House	3
Since local benefit-seeking matters more	national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress	3
this is precisely the pattern one would expect	Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts	2
Second Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking	the key assumption is valid	2
that such votes reflect national policy making	that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking	3
Second Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking	This is what the data indicate, particularly in the case of the House	3
First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do.	as shown in the table, Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices	3
where local benefit-seeking duties matter more	national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices	3
Finally, as shown in the table, Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices	An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 (when control of that body changed party hands) reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table cannot be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise, due to their majority-party status, over other resources such as committee staff	3
Put more simply, GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate	the prisoner's dilemma is more severe	2
Put more simply, GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate	the prisoner's dilemma is more severe	4
Put more simply, GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner's dilemma is more severe	ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level	3
State government is more typically split along Republican-governor/Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse	that, holding other factors constant, the difference between a state's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate	3
First that GOP senators turn back roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do. Second, if the key assumption is valid, Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking. Finally, as shown in the table, Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices An additional piece of evidence from the Senate: Holding other factors constant, such as incumbency advantages and regional factors, the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government's tax burden is per state (a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder Moreover, ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level	at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation	3
The measure provides no money for the promised payments until then	beginning in fiscal 1991, the government would be committed to meeting annual payments of as much as $500 million until the total liability of approximately $1.25 billion is paid	1

The bill doesn't include an estimated $1.9 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds for Justice Department and law-enforcement accounts that are still in conference with the House	yesterday's agreement would make it easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled 50% increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants	1
But yesterday's agreement would make it easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled 50% increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants	the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as New Hampshire and Delaware a minimum allocation of $1.6 million each in drug grants, or three times the current minimum	3

Sebastian Guzman Cabrera took over the oil workers union, Mexico's most powerful labor organization, only last January	even in that short time Mr. Guzman Cabrera has become as controversial in his own way as his deposed predecessor, Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, known as La Quina	1

People will say that the nation and the government have other objectives, in addition to stabilizing the price level, which is true	that is not the same as saying that the Federal Reserve has other objectives	1
The government has other agencies and instruments for pursuing these other objectives	it has only the Fed to pursue price-level stability	1
But it has only the Fed to pursue price-level stability	the Fed has at most very limited ability to contribute to the achievement of other objectives by means other than by stabilizing the price level	3
The two objectives most commonly thought to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the Fed are high employment and rapid real growth	the main lesson of economic policy in the past 30 years is that if the Fed compromises with the price-stability objective in the pursuit of these other goals, the result is not high employment and rapid growth but is inflation	1

No doubt many of his ideas are worthy	ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently	1
Last week, Secretary Kemp ran into a buzzsaw of criticism from House Banking Committee members	They were appalled that he wanted to target more of the $3 billion Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to low-income projects and zero out the notorious "discretionary" funds that have allowed HUD officials to steer contracts to political cronies	3

Builders get away with using sand and financiers junk when society decides it's okay, necessary even, to look the other way	by the early 1980s U.S. capitalists had ample reason to welcome junk bonds, to look the other way	3
By that time they found extremely low profit rates from non-financial corporate investment	Government statistics show that the profit rate -- net pretax profits divided by capital stock -- peaked in 1965 at 17.2%	3
That same calculation saw profit rates fall to 4.6% in the recession year 1982	the supposed miracle that followed has seen the profit rate rise only to 8.1% in 1986 and 8% in 1987	3
in the number arrived at	you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets, the famous Q ratio associated with Prof.	2
In theory, the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same	of course the market could decide that the firm's capital stock -- its assets -- means nothing if the firm is not producing profits	1

that the underlying profitability rate will go up and the capital assets he bought on the cheap will soon be producing profits	restoring the market's faith in them	2
From the history of capitalism we can take it as a sound bet that if it takes only 43 cents to buy a dollar's worth of a firm's capital stock, an alert entrepreneur won't look the other way	here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet, and where society was maybe foolish to look the other way	1
where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet	where society was maybe foolish to look the other way	3
The profit rate is still low	the Q ratio was only 65% in 1987 and 68.9% in 1988	3
The mounting risks did not go unobserved, even in the mid-1980s	there were enough promoters announcing the end of history (in this case suspension of normal laws of economic gravity) for society to continue shielding its eyes	1
Mainstream economists and commentators, craning their necks up at the great pyramids of junk financing, swiveling their heads to watch the avalanche of leveraged buy-outs, claimed the end result would be a leaner, meaner corporate America, with soaring productivity and profits and the weaker gone to the wall	this is not where the rewards of junk financing were found	1

That was the question structural engineers and California transportation officials were asking themselves yesterday	rescue workers began the gruesome task of trying to extract as many as 250 victims from beneath the concrete slabs of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland	4
California Gov. George Deukmejian late yesterday called for an inquiry into the freeway's collapse, blaming the disaster on substandard construction	touring the area	4
The impact of the destruction of this 2.5-mile stretch of highway was tragically measured in lost lives	there are other long-term effects that raise serious questions about the ability of California's infrastructure to withstand a major temblor	1
It could easily be two years	the well-traveled artery that helps connect Oakland with San Francisco is reopened	4
It could easily be two years before the well-traveled artery that helps connect Oakland with San Francisco is reopened	the cost to build a new stretch of highway could soar to more than $250 million	3
The aftershocks of the highway tragedy are reverberating in Los Angeles as well	local politicians spoke yesterday against plans to bring double-decking to Los Angeles freeways by 1994	2
Caltrans abandoned double-decking in the early 1970s, following the 1971 Sylmar earthquake that destroyed freeway sections just north of Los Angeles, Mr. O'Connell explained	why even consider stacking freeways now	2
We've run out of places to build freeways in L.A	the only place to go is up	2
and the only place to go is up	there are many obstacles, including cost	1
there are many obstacles, including cost	as for safety double-deck freeways built today with the heavily reinforced concrete and thicker columns required after the Sylmar quake should withstand a calamitous temblor of 7.5 to 8 on the Richter scale	1
Reasons for the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway were sketchy yesterday	most structural engineers attributed the destruction to improper reinforcement of the columns that supported the decks, and the fact that the ground beneath the highway is largely landfill and can become unstable, or "liquefy," in a major quake	1
they apparently lacked an adequate number of metal "ties" that run horizontally through the column	the pillars did have long metal bars running vertically through them for reinforcement	1
Caltrans today uses a variation of the design Mr. Parker describes, with spiraling steel rods inside	in the case of the Nimitz Freeway, the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to crumble and buckle under the weight of the second deck, crushing motorists who were lined up in bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic on the lower deck nearly 15 feet below	1
Basically, we had a severe earthquake of significant duration	it was just something the structure couldn't withstand	3
Ironically, Caltrans this year began working on a second round of seismic reinforcements of freeways around the state, this time wrapping freeway columns in "steel blankets" to reinforce them	only bridges supported with single rows of columns were top priority, and the Nimitz Freeway, supported by double rows, was left out	1

its havoc hopscotched up the coast in seemingly random fashion	the epicenter of Tuesday's temblor was located 10 miles north of the town of Santa Cruz, and 50 miles south of San Francisco	1
Though the epicenter of Tuesday's temblor was located 10 miles north of the town of Santa Cruz, and 50 miles south of San Francisco, its havoc hopscotched up the coast in seemingly random fashion	the greatest damage was visited on buildings and roadways perched upon landfill, as were the Marina District of San Francisco and the Bay Bridge -- two areas of maximum devastation	1

It will be hard down the road to persuade Congress to approve money for SDI plans if lawmakers fear those plans could scuttle a completed treaty	Frank Gaffney, a former Reagan Pentagon aide who now heads the Center for Security Policy, charges that the administration's "professions of continued commitment to development and deployment of the SDI program strain credulity	2
More ominous to SDI supporters, the Bush administration appears to have tacitly accepted a new arms-control proposal from the Soviet Union that spells long-term trouble for Star Wars	proponents may be shying away from more drumbeating because they sense political tides have turned against arming the Nicaraguan rebels or boosting spending on SDI	1

Other conservative champions, like Wyoming Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop, a longtime SDI advocate, don't have the clout with the Bush White House that they enjoyed with President Reagan	Above all neither the Contra nor the SDI cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support	1

Mr. Wolf has eschewed merger advice from a major Wall Street securities firm	relying only on a takeover lawyer, Peter Atkins of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom	3
