An alternative and more convincing explanation, confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the Gorbachev program, is that the new Soviet economic and social structures are intended to conform to a model other than that of the marketfor example	while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state, strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the development of a free market	3

We do not share this approachsince	it would immediately destroy the social situation and disrupt all the processes in the country	2
Having rejected central economic planning for economic reasons, and the market for fear of the social (political) consequences, Mr. Gorbachev seeks a "third way" that would combine the discipline and controls of the former with the economic benefits of the latterindeed	Mr. Gorbachev's proposals display a close conceptual resemblance to the tenets of Italian fascism, whose architects spoke specifically of a "third way": of having produced a historic synthesis of socialism and capitalism	3
The fascist concept of corporatism envisaged an "organic" society in which citizens were spiritually and morally unified, and prepared to sacrifice themselves for the nationby contrast	a parliamentary system based on abstract political rights and groups was held to cause, rather than resolve, conflict	1
The closeness of Soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of Mussolini was evidentwhen	Mr. Gorbachev presented his economic vision to the Soviet Congress	4

The Health and Human Services Department currently forbids the National Institutes of Health from funding abortion research as part of its $8 million contraceptive programbut	the Population Council, a 37-year-old, $20 million nonprofit organization that has the backing of the Rockefeller and Mellon foundations and currently subsidizes most U.S. research on contraceptives, has recently been paying for U.S. studies of RU-486 on a license from its French developer, Roussel-Uclaf, a joint subsidiary of the German pharmaceutical company Hoechst and the French government	1
For a woman whose period is late, using RU-486 means no waiting, no walking past picket lines at abortion clinics, and no feet up in stirrups for surgeryalso	It means she will never have to know whether she had actually been pregnant	3
RU-486 is being administered in France only under strict supervision in the presence of a doctorthus	a woman who used RU-486 to have an abortion would have to make three trips to the clinic past those picket lines; an initial visit for medical screening and to take the pill, a second trip 48 hours later for the prostaglandin, administered either via injection or vaginal suppository, and a third trip a week later to make sure she has completely aborted	2
Thus, a woman who used RU-486 to have an abortion would have to make three trips to the clinic past those picket lines; an initial visit for medical screening (anemics and those with previous pregnancy problems are eliminated) and to take the pill, a second trip 48 hours later for the prostaglandin, administered either via injection or vaginal suppository, and a third trip a week later to make sure she has completely abortedfurthermore	because timing is so critical with RU-486, she will learn, via a pelvic examination and ultrasound, not only that she is pregnant, but just how pregnant she is	3

But he didn't know which gene or genes had disappearedthen	a scientific team led by molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee, then at the University of Utah, found the answer	4

and some members of Congress think it's time to take a fresh look at the nation's central bankhowever	Some of the would-be reformers want to restore an arrangement we once had -- or, at least, part of it	1
In the beginning, the treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both ex officio members of the Federal Reserve Boardbut	in 1935, when Congress was trying to find someone or something to blame for the Great Depression, it decided to drop both the secretary and the comptroller from the board	4

that he had a great deal of powerand	somehow that was a good thing	3
that the change would accomplish muchbut	at least Congress, as in 1935, would be doing something	1
Nicholas Brady, the incumbent treasury secretary, is of course aware of the proposaland	he doesn't like it much	3
That may have pleased the secretarybut	H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist of the investment firm of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co., suggests that Mr. Brady may figure he already has all the power he needs	1
Like most treasury secretaries, Mr. Brady takes a keen interest in monetary matters, of coursein fact	He was taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the treasury	3

This recommendation might have encouraged a turf-hungry bureaucrat to try to expand his powerbut	so far Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hasn't made a pitch for the job	1
The Fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoiland	in 1987 and again in 1989 it appears to have handled them well	3
he thought government agencies in the latest market drop were better prepared to coordinate their actionsbut	he has left no doubt that he still likes the ideas the commission advanced nearly two years ago	1
that he still likes the ideas the commission advanced nearly two years agomoreover	In recent weeks Mr. Brady has joined other administration officials in trying to urge the Fed toward lower interest rates	3
the Fed may be slightly more interested in curbing inflation than the administration iswhile	the administration may put slightly more emphasis on spurring economic growth	1
The inflation-growth argument is an old onebut	Mr. Brady, on the board or off, is surely trying to influence Fed policy	1
The treasury can do something on its ownbut	to have any hope of success it needs help from the Fed	1
The Fed has been intervening in foreign currency markets, all rightbut	through August, at least, it appeared to be "sterilizing" the intervention	1
but through August, at least, it appeared to be "sterilizing" the interventionin other words	it was offsetting purchases of marks and yen by buying dollars in the domestic money market	3
it may make them tread a little carefully, for fear of what the central bank may dowhen	traders see the Fed is in the exchange market	2
Now, sterilized intervention may have some effectbut	that sterilized intervention has little or no lasting impact on currency values	1
After August the Fed may have stopped sterilizingbut	it's hard to see much impact on the dollar	1
The Fed has let interest rates slip slightlybut	whether the main reason was dollar intervention, the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment, or the Friday 13 market drop, only Mr. Greenspan and his associates know	1
Trying to manage exchange rates to some desired level would mean diverting monetary and fiscal policies from their customary rolesthereby	and risking excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation	2
This has been a week of stunning events behind what was once called the Iron Curtain and interesting shifts in official American policy toward Moscowalso	It has been a week when inside-the-beltway Washington has had a high old time gnawing over ex-President Reagan's multimillion-dollar junket in Japan	3

For all historians and most journalists, this admission would have been sufficient to condemn the Malcolm articlesbut	Judge Arthur Alarcon, joined by Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall, took the astonishing position that it is perfectly OK to fabricate quotations so long as a judge finds that the fabrications do not alter substantive content or are rational interpretations of ambiguous remarks	1

The pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $200 million, and to commit $200 million from their retirement fundshowever	that banks aren't likely to lend the almost $5 billion that would be necessary for a takeover even at a lower price without someone putting up a hefty wad of cash -- probably even greater than the 17% in cash put up by investors in the leveraged takeover of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Corp. in July	1

to get burnedif	you don't know what you're doing	2
There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you don't know what you're doingso	here's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges	2
Not all exchanges accept every type of orderand	even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange, a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer	3
And a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customerwhen	a specific order is acceptable to an exchange	1

With a market order, an investor tells a broker to buy or sell "at the marketfor example	if wheat is being offered at $4.065 and bid at $4.060, a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price	3

that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokersthen	Profits realized from these trades would be shared by the conspiring brokers	4
Limit orders are usedwhen	investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment	2
Investors may regret the restrictionif	the stock reaches 54 and then falls	2
if the stock reaches 54then	and falls	4
investors aren't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified priceunless	the market goes at least one tick (the smallest price increment permitted) beyond the limit price	3

Once the price reaches that level, a stop order turns into a market orderand	the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get	4
Stop orders are sometimes called "stop-loss" ordersbecause	they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses	2
there is a differencewhile	stop orders sound similar to limit orders	1
Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market priceand	buy stops above	3
Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops abovein contrast	sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below	1

which are filled at the market pricewhen	the stop price is hit	2
it doesn't get filledif	it can't be made at that price	2
Investors who wish to be out of a position, without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order, may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filledbut	if the market moves quickly enough, it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price	1
But it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the orderif	the market moves quickly enough	2
But it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the orderbecause	the investment has passed the specified price	2

Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reachedhowever	unlike a buy-stop order, a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price	1
However, unlike a buy-stop order, a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current pricewhile	a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it	1

It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or betterbut	if the investment can't be bought or sold immediately, the order is automatically canceled	1

On the close" can be added to many types of ordersfor example	market-on-close orders" must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange. "Stop-close-only orders" are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading.

IN SIZING UP the risks of stock-market investments, there's probably no starting place better than "betabut	investors better not ignore its limitations, either	1
The beta of the broad market, typically defined as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, is always 1.0so	a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile, one at 1.5 is 50% more volatile, and so on	2
Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas.though	Remember that beta also has important limitations	1
Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpretalso	that beta has important limitations	3
There is risk that is not associated with market movesand	the beta doesn't tell you the magnitude of that	3
and the beta doesn't tell you the magnitude of thatin particular	beta doesn't measure the company- and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock	3

People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimensionbut	therein lies another aspect of investment risk: the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others	1

They estimate the return a person's current portfolio is likely to generate over time, along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year.and	they eyeball types of risk that are not easily quantified	3
that investors need to considerfor instance	the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk.	3
For instance, the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment riskbut	they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk	1
The younger couple's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfoliobecause	the bulk of the money is in a single issue	2
Note that the younger couple's portfolio has a higher expected annual return, 10.1% vs. 8.8%, as calculated by Seidman Financial Services, which is the financial-planning affiliate of BDO Seidmanbut	one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility	1

Of course, the greater volatility of the younger couple's portfolio doesn't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders' long-term goalsindeed	the older couple's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return won't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans	3

Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilitieswhile	voting in office	4
If they put a Republican into office, not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefitsbut	their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from "bringing home the bacon" to their respective constituencies	3
Each legislator, after all, is only one out of 535when	it comes to national policy making	2

First, why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century Second, it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives Third, the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office Fourth, the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office Fifth, the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the Southfinally	the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House	3

this is precisely the pattern one would expectif	Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts	2

State government is more typically split along Republican-governor/Democratic-legislature lines than the reversefurthermore	that, holding other factors constant, the difference between a state's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate	3

Finally, as shown in the table, Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices An additional piece of evidence from the Senate: Holding other factors constant, such as incumbency advantages and regional factors, the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government's tax burden is per state (a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder Moreover, ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal levelin sum	at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation	3

Last week, Secretary Kemp ran into a buzzsaw of criticism from House Banking Committee membersfor instance	They were appalled that he wanted to target more of the $3 billion Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to low-income projects and zero out the notorious "discretionary" funds that have allowed HUD officials to steer contracts to political cronies	3

Builders get away with using sand and financiers junk when society decides it's okay, necessary even, to look the other wayand	by the early 1980s U.S. capitalists had ample reason to welcome junk bonds, to look the other way	3
By that time they found extremely low profit rates from non-financial corporate investmentin fact	Government statistics show that the profit rate -- net pretax profits divided by capital stock -- peaked in 1965 at 17.2%	3
That same calculation saw profit rates fall to 4.6% in the recession year 1982and	the supposed miracle that followed has seen the profit rate rise only to 8.1% in 1986 and 8% in 1987	3
in the number arrived atif	you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets, the famous Q ratio associated with Prof.	2
In theory, the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the samebut	of course the market could decide that the firm's capital stock -- its assets -- means nothing if the firm is not producing profits	1

From the history of capitalism we can take it as a sound bet that if it takes only 43 cents to buy a dollar's worth of a firm's capital stock, an alert entrepreneur won't look the other waybut	here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet, and where society was maybe foolish to look the other way	1

The profit rate is still lowand	the Q ratio was only 65% in 1987 and 68.9% in 1988	3
The mounting risks did not go unobserved, even in the mid-1980sbut	there were enough promoters announcing the end of history (in this case suspension of normal laws of economic gravity) for society to continue shielding its eyes	1
Mainstream economists and commentators, craning their necks up at the great pyramids of junk financing, swiveling their heads to watch the avalanche of leveraged buy-outs, claimed the end result would be a leaner, meaner corporate America, with soaring productivity and profits and the weaker gone to the wallbut	this is not where the rewards of junk financing were found	1

Reasons for the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway were sketchy yesterdaybut	most structural engineers attributed the destruction to improper reinforcement of the columns that supported the decks, and the fact that the ground beneath the highway is largely landfill and can become unstable, or "liquefy," in a major quake	1
they apparently lacked an adequate number of metal "ties" that run horizontally through the columnwhile	the pillars did have long metal bars running vertically through them for reinforcement	1
Caltrans today uses a variation of the design Mr. Parker describes, with spiraling steel rods insidebut	in the case of the Nimitz Freeway, the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to crumble and buckle under the weight of the second deck, crushing motorists who were lined up in bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic on the lower deck nearly 15 feet below	1
Basically, we had a severe earthquake of significant durationand	it was just something the structure couldn't withstand	3
Ironically, Caltrans this year began working on a second round of seismic reinforcements of freeways around the state, this time wrapping freeway columns in "steel blankets" to reinforce thembut	only bridges supported with single rows of columns were top priority, and the Nimitz Freeway, supported by double rows, was left out	1
