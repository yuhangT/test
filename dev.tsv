The continuing series of HUD scandals is a sadly predictable result of pork-barrel politics	lobbies such as the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) continue to pressure Capitol Hill for more special-interest spending	1

It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation, particularly zoning and building fees, which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low- and middle-income people	while the NAHB has suggested actions that states and localities should take to reduce regulatory barriers, the association has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to, say, its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- to eliminate counterproductive controls	1
